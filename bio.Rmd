<div align="justify">
I recently handed in my doctorate thesis investigating the individual differences in the bilingual language switching abilities. I graduated with an MSc in Evolution of Language and Cognition from the University of Edinburgh in 2017, and an MSc in Intercultural Communication from the University of Warwick in 2015. In my MSc theses, I investigated the learnability of evidentiality grammatical structures for bilinguals, and cultural identity of bilingual speakers of endangered Mesoamerican languages. I gained my undergraduate degree in Psychology in 2010 from Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski", Bulgaria. 

My current work revolves around cognition and bilingualism, and I'm particularly interested in how individual differences of daily language practices affect cognition and brain functioning. Another significant part of my interests includes brain functioning and structure in dementia and healthy aging. I do my best to carry out my work according to the field's Open Scholarship standards for transparency and reproducibility, and I also investigate the application of Open Scholarship myself.
