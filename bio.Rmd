# Bio

<div align="justify">
In my current postdoctoral research, I'm working on frontotemporal and Alzheimer's dementia using multimodal (structural, task fMRI, resting-state fMRI and MR spectroscopic) neuroimaging data. I'm also gaining some practical training in focused ultrasound brain stimulation, a highly innovative non-invasive brain stimulation technique. My research interests revolve around cognition in dementia and in the healthy adult brain, and I'm particularly interested in how individual bilingual experiences could affect brain functioning and structure in (late) adulthood (i.e., does bilingualism provide a cognitive/brain reserve). I do my best to carry out my work according to the field's Open Scholarship standards for transparency and reproducibility, and I also investigate the application of Open Scholarship myself, as a proud member of the <a href="https://forrt.org/" target="_blank">Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT)</a> and the Feminist Wonder Lab. 

My past PhD research investigated the individual differences in the bilingual cognition and language switching abilities. I graduated with an MSc in Evolution of Language and Cognition from the University of Edinburgh in 2017, and an MSc in Intercultural Communication from the University of Warwick in 2015. My MSc theses studied the learnability of evidentiality grammatical structures for bilinguals, and the cultural identity of bilingual speakers of endangered Mesoamerican languages. I gained my undergraduate degree in Psychology in 2010 from Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski", Bulgaria.
