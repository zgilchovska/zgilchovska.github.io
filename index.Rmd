I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/" target="_blank">Department of Psychology of the University of York</a>, where I work on a multi-study longitudinal project, investigating bilingual language control in healthy aging and aging with mild cognitive impairment, supervised by <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/amdb504/" target="_blank">Dr. Angela de Bruin</a>. I'm also a Teaching Fellow at the School of Psychology, University of Birmingham. 

Previously I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the School of Psychology, University of Nottingham, working with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=qItWAK4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. JeYoung Jung</a>. I finished my PhD in the School of Psychology, University of Birmingham. My two superhero supervisors were <a href="https://andreakrott.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Andrea Krott</a> and <a href="https://alimazaheri.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Ali Mazaheri</a>. 

My research interests include bi-/multilingualism as a possible cognitive/brain protective life-long experience, dementia and healthy aging, cognitive control, language control, brain functioning and structure in healthy adults and in dementia. I'm also very passionate about Open Scholarship and doing and teaching better science.
